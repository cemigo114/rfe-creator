    One ``python3 scripts/frontmatter.py set`` per id, field for field the stub
    ``validate_types.build_error_stub`` mirrors (gate 1 checks the shape against the
    type's review schema): ``<id_field>=<id>``, ``error=<phase>_<outcome>``, the fixed
    stub vocabulary, one ``scores.<f>=0`` per registry score field, then
    ``type=<pipeline_type>`` — the self-describing field every new artifact carries
    (design §5, PR-3c), appended after the pre-3c fields so they keep their order (on disk
    the schema defaults ``frontmatter.py set`` materializes follow it). ``outcome`` is
    ``failed`` for the post-barrier verifier (the agent finished without its output)
    and ``stalled`` for pipeline_state's wave stall guard (the agent never finished);
    both classify as retryable in error_collect.py. ``error`` replaces the derived
    ``<phase>_<outcome>`` value outright: the stall guard uses it to keep the
    non-retryable ``split_not_attempted:`` class when a split parent's review has to
    be replaced by the stub.

    ``frontmatter.py set`` merges the stub into an existing review and validates the
    merged record, so it also repairs a review the schema rejects in a field the stub
    sets (``feasibility: likely``). It cannot repair one rejected in a field the stub
    leaves alone — a half-written review with an unknown ``scores`` member — and a stub
    that silently goes unwritten leaves the id dropped from its ids file with no error
    marker: error_collect never retries it and the run report shows it failed for no
    reason. So when the merge fails, the review's frontmatter is replaced outright with
    the stub (``artifact_utils.write_frontmatter``, which keeps the body it can read) and
    one stderr line names the id and frontmatter.py's reason. One bad id still cannot
    take the caller down: the ids for which even the replacement failed are reported on
    stderr and returned (an empty list when every stub is on disk). ``failures``, when a
    dict is given, additionally receives ``id -> reason`` for those ids (the same reason
    the stderr line carries), for a caller that has to report them itself.

    Reviews are not stamped by prompt edits: after the review barrier the verifier appends
    the self-describing field deterministically, one file at a time, through
    ``artifact_utils.append_frontmatter_field`` — the one ``type: <t>`` line is inserted
    before the closing ``---`` and every other byte stays as the agent wrote it. It is
    deliberately not a ``frontmatter.py set``: that re-dumps the merged record, so on a
    review that predates the current schema (a workspace re-run over an older results tree)
    it would also materialize ``local_id: null`` and the other defaults, rename ``revised``
    and re-wrap long strings — more than the single appended field D7 allows on an artifact
    this writer did not produce. On a review the agents wrote in-run the bytes are the same
    either way. The caller invokes this only for a review that exists with a usable score,
    declares no ``type`` yet and whose path stays inside the reviews directory (an id that
    would resolve outside it is failed, never stamped — ``_outside_reviews_dir``, the guard
    ``write_error_stubs`` applies), so the stamp is idempotent across re-runs (the reassess
    pass verifies the same ``review`` phase and goes through here too) and a review that
    already carries ``type`` is never rewritten — one that declares the pipeline's type is
    left alone silently, one that declares anything else (another type, an empty string) is
    not this writer's to overwrite: verify() reports it once on stderr and leaves it
    byte-identical. Returns True when the stamp is on disk. A
    failure — the merged record is validated exactly as ``frontmatter.py set`` validates it,
    so a review the schema rejects in some other field cannot take the stamp — is reported
    once on stderr and leaves the review exactly as it was: the stamp never changes the
